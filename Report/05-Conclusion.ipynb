From this data, it was easy to establish key epidemological metrics such as death counts, case counts and vaccination rates. \n","\n","This included:\n","\n","1. Cumulative tolls\n","\n","Most of the datasets were in time-series meaning it was easy to calculate values such as total_cases and total_deaths (where these values were then smoothed to create a rolling average). The normalised versions of these values e.g. total_cases_per million or total_deaths_per_million to account for population differences were also frequently used. \n","\n","2. Hospital data\n","\n","Much of the data was related to hospital and ICU patient counts as well as vaccination and booster rates, with all these values being smoothed and normalised as before.\n","\n","3. Demographic Data \n","\n","The final columns of the Our World In Data dataset were demographic factors that categorize populations based on health indicators such as human development index (HDI), life expectancy, and handwashing facilities (as a % of the total population) which could be considered a contributing factor in disparities in covid rates. \n","\n","This quantative data is important as it allowed for data visualisation through various plotting libraries in both R and python. This allowed for the datasets to be interpreted in a more digestable format, allowing us to communicate trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent in their raw numerical form. \n","\n","Data visualisation prompted further statistical analysis by acting as a springboard for regression modelling. We were encouraged to examine how particular factors may correlate and with the key metrics previously mentioned.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," \n","\n","\n","\n","**2) What are the main types of resource?**\n","\n","**3) How might the approach be compared to other approaches, and/or applied across different datasets?** \n","\n","**4) How is the experience of sharing code via GitHub limiting, and/or enabling?**\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"R","language":"R","name":"ir"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":"r","file_extension":".r","mimetype":"text/x-r-source","name":"R","pygments_lexer":"r","version":"3.6.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
