## Data Import 

To automate this, DIFFERENTLY AND BETTER THAN THE RECORDING, we will use internal R functions which work regardless of file system. We would like a cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac) solution, and this is provided by the `file.path` function in R.

We want to obtain the data here:

https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/hospitalizations


```{r}
base_path <- "C:/Users/markm/OneDrive/Documents/University/Year 4/dst/data"

# Use file.path to create the full path to the CSV file
csv_file_path <- file.path(base_path, "test_financial_dataset.csv")

# Now read the CSV file
data <- read.csv(csv_file_path)

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(data)

```

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(r"C:/Users/markm/OneDrive/Documents/University/Year 4/dst/data/test_financial_dataset.csv")

print(df)

```
